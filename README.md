As you can see it's Bee-liever's "Album Tiles", but with an enlarged now-playing album cover, the ordering of the tiles now snakes from left-to-right and down and the brightness for the tiles descends inversely to the play order. Custom fonts used are Handwind for the Artist name and Roboto Condensed for the text.
Only works properly when the Theatre Panel Dock startup mode is set to Fullscreen.
Place the XML in MusicBee\Plugins\TheaterMode.List\
